Mini Security Operations Center simulation Project
# 🛡️ Mini Security Operations Center (SOC)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a **Mini Security Operations Center (SOC)** simulation.  
It is designed for **beginners** to understand how real-world cybersecurity monitoring systems work.

The system **simulates cyber attacks in real time**, processes security events, categorizes threats based on severity, and displays incidents on a simple dashboard for security analysts.

This project was built as a **learning + hackathon project**.

## 🎯 What This Project Does

✔ Simulates fake cyber attacks (like brute force, malware, port scans)  
✔ Sends attack data to a backend server  
✔ Analyzes and categorizes threats (Low / Medium / High / Critical)  
✔ Stores incidents  
✔ Displays alerts and dashboards for analysts  

Think of it like a **practice SOC lab**, not a real security system.

## 🧠 How a Real SOC Works

1. An attack happens  
2. Logs/events are generated  
3. SOC system receives the events  
4. Threats are analyzed  
5. Alerts are shown to analysts  
6. Analysts take action  

This project **simulates all these steps**.

## 🧩 Project Components

### 1️⃣ Attack Simulator
- Generates fake cyber attack events
- Acts like hackers attacking a system

### 2️⃣ Backend Server
- Receives attack events
- Processes and analyzes them
- Decides threat severity

### 3️⃣ Threat Detection Engine
- Uses simple rules (if-else logic)
- Categorizes threats based on type and intensity

### 4️⃣ Incident Management
- Creates incidents for serious threats
- Stores incident data

### 5️⃣ Analyst Dashboard
- Displays incidents and alerts
- Shows attack trends and severity levels
